      <h6 class="double-u">Background</h6>
      <p>Missy is a nationally certified and state licensed Occupational Therapist, Driving Rehab Specialist and Driving Instructor.</p>
      <p>With over 25 years experience working with diverse populations across the lifespan, most of her focus has been on supporting and empowering persons/families dealing with invisible differencesand helping those who are underserved by health system cracks. She has held pediatric practice emphasis since 2002 but began training to work with adult driving rehab needs after getting so many specialty-case adult referrals to her pediatric driving program. </p>
      <p>Her OT Driving Rehabilitation experience began in 2001 at North Kansas City Hospital. There she completed clinical evaluation and potential to drive assessments with adults due to age-related or disability factors including Stroke, Dementia, Alzheimer’s, Brain Injury, Parkinson’s/MS, and Orthopedic challenges.</p>
      <p>Helping families and adults with “hidden disabilities” is her primary passion along with driving. Missy created and ran a specialty therapy and educational support services clinic called Extra Credit! LLC. A major success of her business was related to a Driving Readiness Program (called DRT). Much of her work was based on specialized training she received from Dr. Miriam Monahan, an expert in the field of driving rehabilitation and extensive educator in the field. Dr. Monahan granted permission for some of her own training materials to be used in the DRT and a supplemental helper packet. Local driving specialists at St. David’s Adaptive Driving program still use Missy’s Driver Helper Program as a treatment reference.</p>
