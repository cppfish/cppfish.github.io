    <p>Sometimes for driving independence or to make driving the most safe, special tools are required. I can work with clients to learn to use some basic low-tech driving equipment and prescribe equipment needs to vendors for installation. For more complex equipment needs I can refer you to an additional specialist and vehicle modifier. I can help elderly drivers be better positioned and set up for driving by completing a complementary CarFit screening or help a whole community of aging adults by helping host a volunteer event. For parents who want to do in-car driving instruction, I can make safe choices regarding beneficial accessories and even suggest a variety of options for personal training brakes.
