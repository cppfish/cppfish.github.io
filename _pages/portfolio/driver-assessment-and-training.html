    <p>I can provide mobile services for driver rehabilitation needs in the Austin metro area. In some cases, I may be able to travel further for an additional fee or arrange to see multiple clients for a travel discount. All services are private pay Occupational Therapy Driving Rehabilitation services which you can submit to insurance for potential reimbursement. A physician referral/script with medical diagnosis is required. The intake process includes full release of health history information and liability waiver as well as an understanding and acceptance of all service fees/billed charges and recommendations. Partial payment is made in advance to reduce appointment no-shows or late cancellations. I reserve the right to refuse or halt services to anyone for any reason at any time.
