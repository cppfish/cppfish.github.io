    <p>If you have a non-medical condition and are seeking regular assistance with learning to drive for licensure, I can teach you as a regular instructor through Drivers Ed.com. Please contact them directly and mention this referral code if you would like to work with me: <a href="mailto:MBell@driversed.com"> MBell@driversed.com</a>. The car that I am assigned to is located in area code 78746 and I can provide services within a 30 minute drive. All coursework is done online through Drivers Ed.com.</p>
    <p> I am working very hard to create a remedial driver ed teaching program for the school to help serve more diverse needs with individualized driving plans such as ADHD. It's important that instructors obtain appropriate training to work with ADHD/ADD and related issues behind the wheel. The school does not have plans to do any driving rehab services in the future and will not be making any adaptive equipment vehicle modifications. The safest approach with conditions like Autism, Anxiety, ADHD, SPD, Visual &amp; Auditory Processing Differences, age-related driving challenges and beyond is to work with a driving rehabilitation specialist such as myself through a driving rehabilitation program.
