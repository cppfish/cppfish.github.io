    <p>For the past decade I have referred to St. David's Adaptive Driving Program and I may soon be working with the team on a limited basis. They offer clinical and in-car evaluations as well as equipment recommendations and training. In fact, St. David's still uses my Driving Readiness Program training as a useful resource with students. Contact them about payer options and scheduling. Often there is a wait list for services.</p>
    <p>Hours are weekdays only. All testing and training is performed at the downtown outpatient rehabilitation center by Occupational Therapists. You can expect to get a summary of findings on the same day of testing. They have a well equipped vehicle (and a second one is coming soon) to help with a variety of needs.</p>
    <p>A physician's referral and a valid driver's license or permit are required.</p>

    <p>For information, contact St. David's Rehabilitation at (512) 544-5116</p>
